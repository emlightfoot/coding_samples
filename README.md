Coding samples for Stata, R, and Python

'stata_sample': My Stata sample is from a data analysis assignment in which I was exploring whether or not financial support to private firms improves their self-sustained growth and employment. I employed a regression
discontinuity design to determine the causal effect of government support on firm outcomes.

'r_sample_code': This sample code in R is taken from the code I used for my undergraduate thesis: 'Firm Decision-Making After Hurricane Harvey'. In this sample I am 1) downloading data on Texas business acitvity
for the years 2013-2017, 2) cleaning the data and removing duplicates, 3) creating a unique business ID and a binary firm exit variable, and 4) running regression analysis and generating a regression table.

'python_sample_code': In this sample I am downloading police incidents data for Boston, cleaning the raw incidents descriptions, and downloading the Boston police boundaries. This code was taken from my
work as a research assistant for Evan Rose at the Becker Friedman Institute.
